### SonarQube

The application url are:

```url
http://localhost:9000
```
On your first access, you are going to be redirected to the login page, the credÃªntials are:
```
login: admin
password: admin
```
After login, you have to change the password, so use the word **sonar** as password for our example works.

#### Using sonarqube on your project 
For run sonar in your code, you need to run first your tests, so that will be used on sonarqube:
```ssh
./gradlew clean test
```
After that you can run the command:
```ssh
./gradlew sonarqube
```
And access your application report.

### New Relic

Create the file  **`newrelic.yml`** and add this on your project file root. Obs: This file can be found into your account or in this link:
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-config-file-template/

You need to change two params inside this file:
**app_name** e **license_key**

The license_key you going to find in this link:
https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/api-keys/home

Use the key TYPE: **INGEST - LICENSE** for license_key

For the field app_name, you can choose any name. I'm using `Good Practices API`

Latter that in your project configurations do that configurations

`-javaagent:newrelic.jar`
`-Xmx512m`
